# COVID-TB-Tracking
A project to determine whether countries with higher COVID-19 burden routinely vaccinate against Tuberculorsis

# Introduction
COVID-19 emerged late in 2019 to become a pandemic, which the world is currently struggling to contain. While there have been efforts on multiple fronts to develop therapies and a preventative vaccine, pushing these pro- and post-exposure prophalactic drugs taken months to develop and approve for widespread human use and distribution. There have been inquiries to look into whether currently used vaccines have any protective effect against COVID-19, in an effort to utilize what is already approved. 
Some months ago, researchers noticed that countries which have widespread vaccination with the BCG-vaccine (the tuberculosis vaccine) have disproportionately lower rates of COVID-19 burden. Though there are likely multiple factors at play, I decided to simply determine whether there was a correlation between countries which vaccinate against tuberculosis and COVID-19 burden.

# Dataset
The data in the dataset I created was taken from the Worldometer for COVID-19 cases, found here: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ for 15 May 2020.

# Userguide
Please see the final project code for details on running the code.
